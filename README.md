**74LS95N**

Code to couple an Arduino with 74LS95N Serial to Parallel Multiplexer
IC. This is useful to get more input pins, as we have a limited number
of IO pins on the Arduino.

**7 Segment**

Complete code, written from scratch to run a run a 7-segment display
using Arduino. It can display all Hexa-decimal numerals 0-F.
Can be clubbed with 74LS95N to get more displays running, with just 3 IO
pins.

**Auth pass btn arr motors**

Controls a digital security door. When the correct password is entered
through a parallel key-pad, the motors rotate in one direction and pause
for a while. Then an equal number of turns in the opposite direction.
Also have a few LED pins, to act as indicators of door opening or closing.

**Keypad**

Code to control a parallel keypad, using the Arduino.

**Keypad 7 segment**

Code to control keypad and 7 segment display at-once. The key you press
on the keypad is echoed on the 7-segment display.

**Keypad binary LED**

Displays the binary equivalent of the number on the keypad pressed,
using a set of 4 LED's.

**Pass led motors**

Similar to Auth pass btn arr motors, but slightly different
implementation

**Mar14 / Blink Without Delay**

A simple LED blink program

**Mar14 / Digital Read Serial**

Interfacing the Arduino with a digital computer. The Arduino just echoes
the input from a sensor to the USB port of a digital computer.
